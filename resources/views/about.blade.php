            <h2>MSEUF CONCERT SINGERS BRIEF HISTORY</h2>
                <p>Once known as the LUF Concert Singers, the MSEUF
                    Concert Singers was founded by Dr. Jaime M. Buzar in
                    1974. Together with its founding choirmaster, Prof.
                    Belen V. Obispo, they named the group “Concert
                    Singers” through the combination of names of the
                    most widely known choral groups at that time
                    namely: UP Concert Chorus and the UP Madrigal
                    Singers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The legacy of the MSEUF Concert Singers
                    harmoniously continues through the years with the
                    help and supervision of its devoted conductors: <br>
                    Prof Belen V. Obispo (1974 to 1984)<br>
                    Prof. Jospehine J. Fabre (1985 to 2009)<br>
                    Prof. Michael Villamayor (2010 to 2016)<br>
                    Prof. Hubert P. Loresto (2017 to present)<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The MSEUF Concert Singers started with 28 members
                    and they specialized in a cappella singing.
                    Six years after its founding, it bagged the
                    championship in the regional level competition for
                    college choirs in the National Music Competition for
                    Young Artists (NAMCYA) in 1980.

                    one of the longest staying student choirs in the
                    country.
